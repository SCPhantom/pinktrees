# Pink Trees
Pink Trees is an OpenGL project that we developed in the courses *Computer Graphics for Games* and *Three-Dimensional Visualization and Animation* on the Insituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The main goal was to learn about OpenGL and computer graphics techniques for educational purposes. To illustrate the techniques, we chose to create a simple scene containing pink cherry trees that is rendered using *physically based rendering* and *deferred shading*.
